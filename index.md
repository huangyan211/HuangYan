## About Me

Welcome to my webpage! 

I am interested in applied macroeconomics. More broadly, I am interested in how people form beliefs in an information-rich world, and how those beliefs influence economic outcomes. 

My goal is to investigate the impact of preferences, personalities, and decisions on economic, health, labor market, and environmental outcomes using bounded rationality methods to solve problems,such as social and business, economic and environmental sustainability. 
 
My vision is for people to have an equal opportunity to manage their own lives.
