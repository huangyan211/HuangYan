## About Me

Welcome to my webpage! 

I am a Masters Student at Belarusian State University.

My primary research interests are in economics and applied macroeconometrics. More broadly, I am interested in how people form beliefs in an information-rich, attention-scarce world, and how those beliefs influence economic outcomes. 

I take an application-oriented research approach, focusing on real-world data problems. My goal is to investigate the impact of preferences, personalities, and decisions on economic, health, labor market, and environmental outcomes using bounded rationality methods. These are statistically significant and practically relevant questions.

I believe that innovative research is about bringing together people and ideas. 
My vision is for all people to have an equal opportunity to choose, plan, and manage their own lives and communities, to have a local influence, and to understand the games and trade-offs involved in solving social and business problems, as well as economic, national, and global development, including social and environmental sustainability. Simultaneously, academics can promote innovative thinking on (the causes and consequences of inequality) and the frontier of (economics) research.
