## About Me

Welcome to my webpage! 

I am a Masters Student at Belarusian State University. My primary research interests are in economics and applied macroeconometrics. More broadly, I am interested in how people form beliefs in an information-rich, attention-scarce world, and how those beliefs influence economic outcomes. 

I believe that innovative research is about bringing together people and ideas. My goal is to investigate the impact of preferences, personalities, and decisions on economic, health, labor market, and environmental outcomes using bounded rationality methods. These are statistically significant and practically relevant questions.
 
My vision is for all people to have an equal opportunity to choose, plan, and manage their own lives and communities, to have a local influence, and to understand the games and trade-offs involved in solving social and business problems, as well as economic, national, and global development, including social and environmental sustainability.
